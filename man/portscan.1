.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm portscan
.Nd "scan the FreeBSD Ports Collection"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l Ar logdir
.Op Fl o
.Fl p Ar portsdir
.Op Ar origin ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
scans the
.Fx
Ports Collection for variable and target misspellings and other mistakes.
At the moment it flags unknown variables and targets.
.Pp
The entire collection is scanned if no port origins are given.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl l Ar logdir
Save the log result into
.Ar logdir
instead of outputting to
.Sy stdout .
The log files will be dated and will include the current SVN
revision or Git commit hash of
.Ar portsdir .
.Nm
creates
.Pa portscan-latest.log
and
.Pa portscan-previous.log
symlinks to point to the latest or previous results.
.It Fl o
Include port options and option groups in the result.
.It Fl p Ar portsdir
The port directory to scan.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT
The output is composed of whitespace delimited fields
.Sy type ,
.Sy origin ,
.Sy name .
.Sy type
is made up of the following characters:
.Bl -hang
.It Sy OG
Port option group
.It Sy O
Port option
.It Sy V
Unknown variable
.It Sy Vc
Variable that is set twice or more
.It Sy T
Unknown target
.El
.Pp
.Sy origin
is the origin of the variable or target.
.Pp
.Sy name
is the variable or target name.
.Sy name
might contain whitespace as part of its value.
.Sy name
never starts with whitespace.
Any tools that consumes
.Nm
output should keep this in mind.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will exit with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
The collection was scanned successfully.
An exit status of 0 does not mean there were no issues in the scanned
ports.
.It 1
An error occurred.
.It 2
There were no changes when compared to previous results.
Only possible when
.Fl l
was passed to
.Nm .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The output can have many lines (approximately 12000 lines at the
time of writing) and will have many false positives.
To not be overwhelmed it is best to run
.Nm portscan
daily in an iterative manner and compare the results with
.Xr diff 1
to flag new problems:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
portscan -l . -p /usr/ports
diff -u portscan-previous.log portscan-latest.log
