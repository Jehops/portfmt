.Sh NAME
.Nm portclippy
.Nd "lint FreeBSD Ports Collection Makefiles"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar Makefile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool for linting
.Fx
Ports Collection Makefiles.
.Pp
At the moment it only checks variable order and is a companion tool
for
.Xr portlint 1 .
.Pp
If the optional
.Ar Makefile
argument is not given, the Makefile will be read from stdin.
.Pp
.Nm
will output a skeleton view of the port.
It can be used to check if a variable is in the right position.
It is heavily inspired by Chapter 15 of the Porter's Handbook and
provides an objective measure for it.
.Pp
Variables in wrong positions will be marked with -.
The position they should appear in is marked with a +.
.Pp
Variables that start with an underscore _ will be ignored.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev CLICOLOR_FORCE"
.It Ev CLICOLOR_FORCE
If defined
.Nm
will output text with ANSI colors even when stdout is not a tty or
.Ev NO_COLOR
is set.
.It Ev NO_COLOR
If defined colors will be disabled.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will exit with 0 if it could not find a problem, and >0 if there are
issues.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal

The output of
.Nm
is inspired by unified
.Xr diff 1
output.
Here RUN_DEPENDS is in the wrong position (marked with -) and
should be moved to before USES (marked with +).
