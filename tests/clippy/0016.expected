# Unknown variables
# WARNING:
# Portclippy did not recognize the following variables.
# They could be local variables only, misspellings of
# framework variables, or Portclippy needs to be made aware
# of them.  Please double check them.
#
# Prefix them with an _ to tell Portclippy to ignore them.
# This is also an important signal for other contributors
# who are working on your port.  It removes any doubt of
# whether they are framework variables or not and whether
# they are safe to remove/rename or not.
